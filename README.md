# NRF24L01-ARM-32Bit-STM32-Library
in this project I've tried to use NRF2401 module for a long distance communication through Cm9.04 Robotis controller which is based on STM32f103CBT6 micro controller

to use it just you have to copy the extracted folder file to the library folder of your compiler source which its address could be something like this: C:\ROBOTIS\ROBOTIS-v1.0.4-windows\libraries\
